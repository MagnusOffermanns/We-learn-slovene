## Exercises
Each chapter has a row of exercises to complete. There are different kinds. For instance Cloze exercises, Listening exercises, writing exercises, speaking exercises. Each exercise type has an emoji so that when you see the emoji you know what kind of exercise it will be.

Cloze Exercises:

👂 Listening Exercises:
For the listening Exercises we provide little mp3s that you can either listen to on our website or can download and do apart. The links will be provided on the website under the exercise.

✍ Writing Exercises:
This is an exercise in which you need to write a text.

👅 Speaking Exercises:
This is a speaking exercise. Preferably it should be performed with a slovene Speaker in the wild or a fellow co-learner who is willing to complete the exercise with you.

🤖 AI Exercises:
These exercises are AI enhanced. It might be a exercise in which you need to chat or talk with an AI in slovene. The prompt that you can insert into a AI chatbot of your choice is always provided like this:

>[!NOTE] AI-Prompt 🤖
>Your task is for someone to learn slovene with. You have to come up with a persona with the following information:
>
>- A name
>- Your age
>- A hobby
>- A place where you are from
>- Your favorite dish
>
>The task of the learner is to introduce himself and then slowly determine what your name, hobby, place from where you are from and your favorite dish is. The conversation should not be a riddle but a normally flowing conversation.
> From now on only speak slovene! Your slovene level should be for beginners.
> If the learner has found out all facts about you, print an ascii art using ascii but also emojis. And give him a litle victory message.
> Only write "v redu" if you understood your task and wait for the person to initiate the conversation.
