Title: "How to Pronounce Slovene words"
weight: 2
---

After learning the different letters of the Slovene alphabet, we will dive into the pronunciation of Slovene words. We will give you an overview of how to pronounce each letter, with an example word. I will try to provide the [IPA pronounciation code](https://www.vocabulary.com/resources/ipa-pronunciation/) for each word, but for everyone who is not fluent in these very mysterious letters I will also provide audio via [forvo.com](https://forvo.com) so that you can listen to the pronunciation.

As the pronunciation rules of Slovene are rather complex, I want to give you a practical overview of the pronunciation. I will show you each letter and a couple of examples of how to pronounce the letter in different contexts. In this way we also learn some useful phrases that we can then use when strolling through the streets of Ljubljana or walking the meadows of Velika planina.

(Don't worry, the hard ones like `č`,`š`,`v` and `l` are getting some extra explanation 😋)

I will provide some Anki decks so that you can train the pronunciation of some Slovene words and sentences by yourselves and can practice applying the rules we have looked into in this chapter.

Let's start!

## Pronunciation of vowels

First we will look at the vowels, i.e., `a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`.

- `A`

  The `a` can be pronounced in a long way like in the word "far" (**long**); an example is the word `mati`, meaning mother [📢](https://forvo.com/word/mati/#sl).

  The second way `a` can be pronounced is like the a in "above" (**short**), sounding like (uh); `rama` means shoulder [📢](https://forvo.com/word/rama/#sl).

- `E`

    The `e` can also be pronounced in two ways. The first is pronounced **long** in `bled` (ehh) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/energija/#sl).

    The second way to pronounce the letter `e` is **short**, like in the English word `met` (eh); "energija" (energy) is an example [📢](https://forvo.com/word/energija/#sl).

- `I`

    The `i` can also be pronounced in two ways, short and long. The first way to pronounce `i` is like the English "ee" in "see"; one example in Slovene would be `vino` (wine) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/vino/#sl).

    The second way to pronounce the `i` is short, like in the English word "bit" (ih); `list` (leaf / sheet) shows this [📢](https://forvo.com/word/list/#sl).

- `O`
    Then we have the `o`, which can also be pronounced long or short. Let's give two examples:
  - **Long** like the "oa" in "cloak"; one Slovene word would be `most`, which means "bridge" [📢](https://forvo.com/word/most/#sl)
  - **Short** like the `i` in the English word "bit"; one Slovene word would be `moka`, which means flour [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ajdova_moka/#sl)

>[!INFO] Znani mostovi Ljubljane (Famous Bridges of Slovenia)
> Ljubljana has two famous bridges, the [dragon bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Bridge_(Ljubljana)) (Zmajski most), which is most likely the most famous one for tourists because it has four beautiful dragon statues. Another beautiful bridge, known for its uniqueness, is [Tromostovje](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tromostovje) (which means three bridges). It is the unofficial center of Ljubljana and is one bridge consisting of three sub-bridges. It is now a beautiful pedestrian area, while just a couple of years ago cars were still able to go over it (exactly till September 2007), which is now unimaginable for all inhabitants of Slovenia. Both bridges go over the Ljubljanica, the river (`reka`) flowing through the capital of Slovenia.

- `U`
    The letter `u` can also be short and long:
  - **Long** like in the English word "pool" – a Slovene example would be `guma` (rubber or tire) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/guma/#sl)
  - **Short** like in the English word "book" – a Slovene example would be `ura` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ura/#sl)

## Pronunciation of consonants

Now we will look at consonants. The ones we are covering here are easy to pronounce. The difficult ones get an extra chapter where we will also give you some examples to train the pronunciation.

- `B`

  The `b` is pronounced like the `b` in "best" (at the end of a word it sounds closer to `p`); `bolha` means flea.

  >[!Note] Bolha.com
  The Slovene Craigslist is named after the flea (maybe because it is a digital flea market?). Under [www.bolha.com](https://www.bolha.com/) one can find everything the Slovene second-hand enthusiast desires.

- `C`

  It is pronounced like the "ts" in "bets". A Slovene word is `car`, pronounced (tsar) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/car/#sl), which means king.

- `Č`

  It is pronounced like the "ch" in the English term "chocolate". A Slovene word is `čmrlj` (bumble-bee [📢](https://forvo.com/search/%C4%8Dmrlj/)).

- `D`

  The `d` can be pronounced in two ways:
  1. First it is pronounced like the `d` in "day" if it is in the middle of a sentence. A Slovene word is `dan`, which means day [📢](https://forvo.com/word/dan/#sl).
  2. If it is at the end of a sentence it is pronounced like the `t` in "cat". One example is the word `led`, which means ice [📢](https://forvo.com/word/led/#sl).

- `F`

  The `f` is pronounced like in "far". An example would be the word `fižol`, which means beans [📢](https://forvo.com/word/fi%C5%BEol/#sl).

- `G`

  The `g` can be pronounced in two ways:
  1. If it is in the middle of a word it is pronounced like in "go"; one example is the word `galeb` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/galeb/#sl).
  2. If it occurs at the end of a word it sounds like the `k` in "rock"; a Slovene example is `rog`, which means "horn" [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ko%C4%8Devski_rog/#sl).

  >[!Note] Legends of Slovenia
  A famous legendary animal of Slovenia is the `zlato rog`, a magical goat with golden horns. It roams Triglav National Park and shows itself only to the luckiest of hikers. It is on the cover of the Slovenian beer Laško.

- `H`

  The `h` is pronounced like the first `h` in "Hanukkah" in Spanish ([📢](https://forvo.com/search/Hanukkah/es/)). One Slovene example would be `hajduk split` (the bandits of Split, the basketball club of Split, a city in Croatia) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/hajduk_split/#hr).

- `J`

  The `j` is pronounced like the `y` in "Yankee"; one example would be the word `jabolko`, which means apple [📢](https://forvo.com/word/jabolko/#sl).

- `K`

  The `k` is pronounced like in the English word "kick". An example word in Slovene is `kava`, the drink that keeps the world going round.

- `L`

  The `l` has three pronunciations:

  1. Like in the English word "left"; one example word would be `letališče`, which means airport [📢](https://forvo.com/word/letali%C5%A1%C4%8De/#sl).
  2. Before consonants it is pronounced like a `w`; an example would be `volk` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/volk/#sl), which means wolf 🐺.
  3. At the end of words it is also pronounced like a `w`; a Slovene example word would be `pol` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/pol/#sl), which means half—e.g., `pol litra piva`, half a liter of 🍺.

- `Lj`

  It is pronounced like the `li` in the French pronunciation of "battalion"; the sound is very uncommon in English and will need a bit of training. A Slovene term where `Lj` is used is "Ljubljana" [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ljubljana/#sl), the beautiful capital of Slovenia.

- `M`

    It is pronounced like the `m` in "mom". The Slovene word `malica` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/malica/#sl), meaning snack or lunch, uses this sound.

- `N`

  The `n` has two pronunciations:

  1. Normally like the `n` in "nothing", for instance in the Slovene word `nogomet`, which means soccer.
  2. In some regions of Slovenia it is pronounced like a ñ as in "Señor" before an `i`; a common trait among Slavs. Examples are `ni` [nyee] or `nitje` (niti) ⚡

- `Nj`

  The combination of `n+j` is pronounced like the `n` in "news". Examples would be `konj`, which means horse [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ljubljana/#sl), or `njiva` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/njiva/#sl), which means field.

- `P`

  It is pronounced like the `p` in "path". One example word would be `pot` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ljubljana/#sl), meaning path or way.

  >[!Note] A `pot` through Slovenia, the **Slovenska planinska pot**
  > The Slovenska planinska pot is a hiking path through all of Slovenia. It starts in the east in Maribor, the second-biggest city of Slovenia, and ends in Ankaran at the coast. It spans 599 km with 45.2 km of ascents. The astonishing thing is that Marjan Zupančič ran the entire distance in about a week—in six days, 12 hours, and 58 minutes.

- `R`
  The `r` has two slightly different ways of pronunciation, depending on whether a vowel follows the `r` (`gora`, `rjav`) or it stands between two consonants (`vrh`, `prst`):
  1. One is a trilled `r`, like the Spanish `r` in "rico"; one Slovene word would be `riba` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/riba/#sl).
  2. The second is like an "er" when used as a vowel, i.e., there is no other vowel after the `r`. Examples would be `Trst` (the city of Trieste [📢](https://forvo.com/word/trst/#sl)), `grm` (bush), or `vrt` (garden [📢](https://forvo.com/search/vrt/sl/)).

- `T`

  The `t` is pronounced like in the English word "taxi"; a Slovene word using the `t` is `tovariš` (comrade [📢](https://forvo.com/word/tovari%C5%A1/#sl)).

- `V`
  The letter `v` can also be pronounced in different ways:
  1. Before a vowel it is pronounced like a `w`; Slovene examples would be `voda` [📢](https://forvo.com/word/voda/#sl) or `vino` [📢](https://forvo.com/search/vino/sl/).
  2. After a vowel and at the end of words it is pronounced like a short `w` glide; examples are `avto` (car [📢](https://forvo.com/word/avto/#sl)) or `ovca` (sheep [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ovca/#sl)).
  3. At the start of a syllable before a consonant it is pronounced like the `oo` in the English expression "oops". Common Slovene word combinations are vs-, vč-, vš-…: `vse` (all [📢](https://forvo.com/word/vse/#sl)), `včeraj` (yesterday [📢](https://forvo.com/word/v%C4%8Deraj/#sl)), and `všeč` (to like [📢](https://forvo.com/word/v%C5%A1e%C4%8D_si_mi/#sl)).

## Summary

I hope you enjoyed the overview of Slovene pronunciation. Most letters have only one pronunciation and are easy to remember. To help you remember the letters with multiple pronunciations, we provide a short overview here before we give you some exercises on how to train pronunciation.

>[!Important] Don't spend too much time here!
> Quickly learn the basic rules of pronouncing and get accustomed to the sounds—for instance with the Anki decks I provide. Then go directly into the next chapter and start talking and writing with the practical exercises there. You will learn the pronunciation on the fly 😀

We want to provide another table for the pronunciation of the letters with a haček, as they are a bit unusual for the foreign eye.


## Exercises

 >[!TIP] Exercise 1: Reading rtvslo.si
> [RTV](https://www.rtvslo.si/) is the public broadcaster of Slovenia and a good source for keeping up with what is going on in Slovenia. As an exercise, choose three different articles and try to read them.
> Then write down ten words that are difficult for you to pronounce from each article and check their pronunciation on [forvo.com](https://forvo.com/)

>[!TIP] Exercise 2: Training pronunciation with Anki
> We have provided a Slovene pronunciation Anki deck where we have extracted interesting Slovene words for you to train. Install the Anki deck and see how solid your pronunciation already is 😁 **TODO ANKIDECK**
