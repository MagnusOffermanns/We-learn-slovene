Title: "How to Pronounce Slovene words"
weight: 2
---

After learning the different letters of the slovene Alphabet we will dive into the pronounciation of slovene words. What we will try to do is to give you an overview over how to pronounce each letter, with an example word. I will try to provide the [IPA pronounciation code](https://www.vocabulary.com/resources/ipa-pronunciation/) of each word but for everyone who is not fluent in this very mistirious letters I will also provide a audio via [forvo.com](https://forvo.com) so that one can also listen to its pronounciation.

As the pronounciation rules of slovene are rather complex I want to give you an applied overview over the pronounciation. I will give you each letter and a couple of examples how to pronounce them letter in different contexts. In this way we also learn some usefull frases that we can then use when strolling through the strees of Ljubljana or walk the medows of Vélika planína.

(Don't worry, the hard ones like `č`,`š`,`v` and `l` are getting some extra explanation 😋)

In the end I will provide some anki decks so that you can train the pronounciation of some slovene words and sentences by yourselfs and can train to apply the rules we have looked into in this chapter.

Lets start!

## Pronounciation of vouwels

First we will look at the vouwels i.e. `a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`.

- `A`
  
  The `a` can be pronounced in a long way like in the word "far" **long* an example is the word `mati` mother [📢](https://forvo.com/word/mati/#sl).

  The second way `a` can be pronounce is like the a in "above" **short** that sounds like (uh) is `rama` which means shoulder [📢](https://forvo.com/word/rama/#sl)

- `E`

    The 'e' can also be pronounced in two ways, the first beeing pronounced **long** in `bled` (ehh) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/energija/#sl)

    The second way to pronounce the letter 'e' is **short** like in the english word `met` (eh) "energija" (energy) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/energija/#sl)

- `I`
  
    Also the I can be pronounced in two ways, short and long. The first way to pronounce i is like the english "ee" in see one exaple in slovene would be `vino` (wine)   [📢](https://forvo.com/word/vino/#sl)

    The second way to pronounce the "i" is short like in the english word "bit" (ih) `list` ( leaf / sheet ) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/list/#sl).

- `O`
    The we have the `O` that can also be pronounced long or short. Lets give two examples:
  - **Long** like the 'oa' in "cloak" one example slovene word would be `most` which means "bridge" [📢](https://forvo.com/word/most/#sl)
  - **Short** like the i in the english word "bit" one slovene word would be `moka` which means flour [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ajdova_moka/#sl)

>[!INFO] Znani mostovi Ljubljane (Famouse Bridges of Slovenia)
> Ljubljana has two famouse bridges, the [dragon bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Bridge_(Ljubljana)) (Zmajski most) which is most likely the most famouse one for tourist because it has 4 beautiful dragon statues. Another beautiful bridge, known for its uniqueness is [Tromostovje](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tromostovje) (which means three bridges) . It is the innoficial center of Ljubljana and is one bridge consisting of three sub-bridges. It is now a beautiful pedestrian area, while just a couple of years ago cars were still able to go over it (exactly till September 2007), which is now unimaginable for all inhabitants of Slovenia. Both bridges go over the Ljubljanica, the river (`reka`) flowing through the capital of Slovenia.

- `U`
    The letter `U` can also be short and long:
  - **Long** like in the english word pool - An slovene example would be 'guma' (rubber or tire) [📢](https://forvo.com/word/guma/#sl)
  - **Short** like in the english word book - An slovene example would be 'ura' [📢](https://forvo.com/word/ura/#sl)

## Summary

I hope you enjoyed the overview over the slovene pronounciation. Most letters have only one pronounciation and are easy to remember, to help you remember the letters with multiple meanings, we will provide a short overview here before we give you some exercises how to train pronounciation.

>[!Important] Don't spend to much time here!
> Quickly learn the basic rules of pronouncing and get accustomed to the sounds, for instance with the anki decks I provide. Then go directly into the next chapter and start talking and writing with the practical exercises there. Then you just learn the pronounciation on the fly 😀

We want to provide another table for the pronounciation of the letters with a haček as they are a bit unusual for the foreign eye:


## Exercises

 >[!TIP] Exercise 1: Reading rtvslo.si
> [RTV](https://www.rtvslo.si/) is the public broadcaster of Slovenia a good source for keeping up about what is going on in Slovenia. As an exercise choose 3 different articles and try to read them.
> Then write down 10 words that are difficult for you to pronounce from each article and check their pronounciation on [forvo.com](https://forvo.com/)

>[!TIP] Exercise 2: Training pronounciation with Anki
> We have provided a slovene pronounciation Anki deck where we have extracted interesting slovene words for you to train. Install the Anki deck and see how solid your pronounciation already is 😁 **TODO ANKIDECK**
