To be able to pronounce all the words we will learn in the slovene language we will have to learn 5 new letters.

## The three common ones Č, Š and Ž

Three of them are used all the time in the slovene language and even have a pronounciation that will give us english (or in my case german) speakers a hard time. They look just like the letter C, S and Z but have a little accent on top. This modifier is called "Haček" (en: hooklet). This letters are very characteristic for all southern slavic languages like slovene, croatian and serbian so that even libraries are called like this symbol ([Book shop haček](https://www.hacek.at/)). It follows a little list of the letters

- Č
  - Example word: haček
- Š
  - Example word: študent (translation: Student)
- Ž
  - Example word: Žale (The most famous graveyard in Ljubljana with nice chappels from the architect Jože Plečnik [wikipedia Žale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDale))

## The two from Serbo- croatian Ć, Đ

The other two letters that we will have to learn are only used in word that are lend or imported from serbocroatian. Another language on the balkan that is mostly spoken in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hence they are actually not part of the O.G. Alphabet. The letters are *Ć* and *Đ*. The letter Ć is the normal letter C with an accent on top (for all french learners a "accent aigu"). The Đ is a D with the horizontal line stiked through:

- Ć
  - Example word: Luka Modrić (One of the most famouse Croatian Soccer players [goal](https://youtu.be/E54aeO2ay4Y?si=00DGFmULF8zoceMz))
- Đ
  - Example word: Novak Đoković (A very successful Serbian Tennisplayer ([hear the legend himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWluaKRyeQw&t=14s)) 

## A note on the letters Q,W,X,Y

While the letters Q,W,X and Y are known to us they are also not part of the original slovene alphabet and are only used in borrowed words from other languages. The nice thing is: we do not have to learn them as we already know them.

## Overview table

In the following table all the letters we will use while learning slovene are shown. The ones that are new to us are bold. The ones that only appear in borrowed words have a little note attached to it.

## Exercises

>[!INFO] Exercise 1: Lets find some usecases
> If you have a slovene book around, open it and search for one word for each letter that is used in the slovene language that contain the letter. Then write them down and find their meaning.
>
> Example:
>
>| Letter | Word  | Translation |
>| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
>| A      | hvala | thank you   |
>| B      | babica| Grandma     |
