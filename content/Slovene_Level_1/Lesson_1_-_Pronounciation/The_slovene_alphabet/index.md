Title: "The Slovene Alphabet"

---

To be able to pronounce all the words we will learn in the Slovene language we will have to learn five new letters.

## The three common ones Č, Š and Ž

Three of them are used all the time in the Slovene language and even have a pronunciation that will give us English (or in my case German) speakers a hard time. They look just like the letter C, S and Z but have a little accent on top. This modifier is called "háček" (en: hooklet). These letters are very characteristic for all southern Slavic languages like Slovene, Croatian and Serbian so that even libraries are called like this symbol ([Book shop Háček](https://www.hacek.at/)). Here is a short list of the letters

- Č
  - Example word: háček
- Š
  - Example word: študent (translation: Student)
- Ž
  - Example word: Žale (The most famous graveyard in Ljubljana with beautiful chapels from the architect Jože Plečnik [wikipedia Žale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDale))

## The two from Serbo-Croatian Ć, Đ

The other two letters that we will have to learn are only used in words that are borrowed or imported from Serbo-Croatian, another language on the Balkan that is mostly spoken in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hence they are actually not part of the O.G. alphabet. The letters are *Ć* and *Đ*. The letter Ć is the normal letter C with an accent on top (for all French learners an "accent aigu"). The Đ is a D with a horizontal line struck through it:

- Ć
  - Example word: Luka Modrić (One of the most famous Croatian soccer players [goal](https://youtu.be/E54aeO2ay4Y?si=00DGFmULF8zoceMz))
- Đ
  - Example word: Novak Đoković (A very successful Serbian tennis player ([hear the legend himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWluaKRyeQw&t=14s)))

## A note on the letters Q, W, X, Y

While the letters Q, W, X and Y are known to us, they are also not part of the original Slovene alphabet and are only used in borrowed words from other languages. The nice thing is: we do not have to learn them as we already know them.

## Overview table

In the following table all the letters we will use while learning Slovene are shown. The ones that are new to us are bold. The ones that only appear in borrowed words have a little note attached to them.

## Exercises

>[!INFO] Exercise 1: Let's find some use cases
> If you have a Slovene book around, open it and search for one word for each letter that is used in the Slovene language that contains the letter. Then write them down and find their meaning.
>
> Example:
>
>| Letter | Word  | Translation |
>| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
>| A      | hvala | thank you   |
>| B      | babica| Grandma     |
>| ...    | ...   | ...         |

After learning what letters there are we also need to pronounce them. Go to the next section of Lesson 1: Pronunciation to learn how to pronounce the letters!
